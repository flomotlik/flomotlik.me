title = "Moving on from Codeship"

+++

This blogpost has been written and re-written in my head a number of times. Leaving Codeship, the company, product and team I’ve been working on, sweating for and bleeding with for the last 5 years was no easy decision.

As with every Startup it was the best of times and it was the worst of times. The ups were an amazing and crazy ride. When the downs hit you could only rely on your Team to get through them. And I did rely on my Team often.

As a company, founding team and individually we made the right or wrong choices regularly. The only choice that I know I got completely right was starting the company together with Manny and Mo. They pushed me far beyond what I thought I was capable of. I learned a lot, but most importantly I learned from both of them in their own way to expect more of myself, work harder than I thought I could and set higher goals than I could imagine. There is a lot of Startup advice I’m happy to share, but the most important one is definitely working with people that are restless and relentless, but at the same time compassionate enough to help you when you struggle.

They both supported my decision last October to leave Codeship and we worked hard together to make sure that the transition out of the company was smooth. I could not have asked for more support or understanding from them or anyone else and had my last day at Codeship with a really nice Team dinner in Boston at the end of February.

Towards the end of my time at Codeship I got to the same kind of place that Greg Brockman of Stripe was describing in his blogpost about leaving Stripe. We hired an amazing VP of Engineering, Jim, grew the Marketing and Sales team with amazing hires and after being part of all those orgs in some way or another we kind of hired myself out of a specific job.

After spending a lot of time in Marketing and Sales for Codeship it was really time for me to work on what I enjoy the most, building product and leading an engineering team. With an existing Engineering team and leadership in place and me not being part of that team for quite a long time I decided that disrupting this team wasn’t in the best interest of myself, the team or the company. One of the most important values we always shared in our founding team and the company is to be ego-less. We do what needs to get done, ego is just something that gets in the way of that. Because of this inherent team and company value it was clear for me that disrupting something that worked well just so I could be part of it was not going to happen. And honestly as a large Shareholder of the company what incentive do I have to make it less productive?

This led me to the decision that instead of trying to shape a role inside of the existing Codeship engineering org it was a better decision to find another opportunity for me to work on.

I will write more about those opportunities in the future, one of them that will require all the leadership skills I can muster will join our little family in September. And I’m more excited about her than anything I’ve ever started in my life.

I really want to congratulate the Team at Codeship for this new fundraising milestone and all the opportunities they can go after now. I know that Manny and Mo together with everyone at Codeship will build something amazing.
