I'm living in Vienna, Austria with my girlfriend and daughter.
 
I primarily work on developer tooling, productivity and processes. As one of the co-founders and former CTO at Codeship I've spent a lot of time working with teams to define and build their CI/CD process as well as building our CI/CD platform.
 
At Serverless I was responsible for moving it to the 1.0 release which meant a complete rewrite while managing the community of contributors. 

Since then I've been a stay at home dad for a while and as of 2017 working in my [AWS and Serverless consultancy](consulting)
