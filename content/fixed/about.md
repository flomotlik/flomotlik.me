I'm living in Vienna with my girlfriend and daughter working on infrastructure tooling. I'm the co-founder and former CTO of Codeship and was CTO of Serverless in 2016. Since then I've been a stay at home dad for a while and as of 2017 working in my AWS and Serverless consultancy [Cloudthropology](http://cloudthropology.com).
